This is a command line interface app that will ask you what the cost of your meal is. Once you have
entered the cost the app will then give you three different tip amounts you can choose from depending 
on how good or bad you feel your dinning service was.

Simply download the python file and run the file with "python simpleTip.py" to run the file and enter 
in the cost when it asks you.
